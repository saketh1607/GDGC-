Execution
To run this project, follow these steps:

Download or Clone the Project:

Download the HTML file or clone the repository if it's hosted on a version control platform like GitHub.

How the Project Was Implemented
HTML Structure:

A single HTML file is used, which includes all the necessary elements such as the product listing area, cart, and price details section.
CSS for Styling:

The CSS is embedded within a <style> tag inside the HTML file.
It provides styling for the product cards, cart, and various UI elements to make the platform visually appealing.
JavaScript for Functionality:

JavaScript code is embedded within a <script> tag in the same HTML file.
A fake API with sample product data is used to simulate product fetching.
JavaScript handles the following functionalities:
Displaying Products: Products are dynamically displayed on the page from the fake API data.
Cart Management: Users can add, remove, and update product quantities in the cart.
Search Functionality: The search box allows users to filter products based on their search query.
Price Calculation: The total amount is calculated based on the items in the cart, including platform fees and shipping charges.
Requirements
Any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
No server or additional software is required. This project is purely front-end and works with a single HTML file.
Notes
The product images and details are placeholders and can be replaced with real data as needed.
The platform's layout and design can be customized further using the embedded CSS.
